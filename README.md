# Analytics 2: Introduction to the command-line for Bioinformatics

## Course Content



This course offers an introduction to working with Linux. We will describe the Linux environment so that participants can start to utilize command-line tools and feel comfortable using a text-based way of interacting with a computer. We give example of processing data arising from Next-Generation Sequencing experiments, in particular an RNA-seq experiment.

## Pre-requisites

No prior programming experience is required. You will need to bring a laptop to the workshop with a working wifi connection.

## Learning Outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

- Connect to a Unix / Linux system
- Navigate around a file system by issuing commands; rather than using a Desktop environment
- Move and copy files and directories within the Linux system
- Work with text files
- Run programs from the command-line
- Run quality assessment tools on data derived from High-throughput sequencing experiments
- Align sequencing reads against a reference genome
